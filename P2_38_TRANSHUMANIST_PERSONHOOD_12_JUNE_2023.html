<p><span style="background:#ffff00">The following paragraphs are a sequel to the web pages of this <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a> named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/attempted_immortality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ATTEMPTED_IMMORTALITY</a>, <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/karbytes_content_management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KARBYTES_CONTENT_MANAGEMENT</a>, and <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/teleology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TELEOLOGY</a>. In particular, the following paragraphs outline karbytes’ conceptualization and idealization of its own <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transhumanist</a> evolution.</span></p>
<p><em>Note that some or all of the paragraphs on this web page which are <span style="background:#00ff00">highlighted green</span> were written by karbytes exclusively for the purpose of articulating and further developing karbytes’ philosophical ideas rather than written for the purpose of being implemented by karbytes outside the context of thought experiments (and a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thought experiment</a> is an imaginary science experiment rather than a science experiment which is physically implemented).</em></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">An idealistic goal which karbytes has is to extend karbytes’ continuity of consciousness for an <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infinitely</a> long period of <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/count_down_timer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time</a>.</span></p>
<p>The entity which karbytes refers to as <strong>karbytes’ continuity of consciousness</strong> is the set of all sensory phenomena and of all cognitive phenomena which are experienced in exactly one chronological order by exactly one discrete, unique, and self-aware <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> which karbytes refers to as karbytes.</p>
<p>The entity which karbytes refers to as <strong>consciousness</strong> is what karbytes theorizes to be a ubiquitous, all-encompassing, irreducible, and phenomenally-neutral substrate which karbytes also refers to as <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pure nothingness</a> (and karbytes makes no distinction between pure nothingness and pure consciousness because karbytes’ mental model of reality is panpsychism).</p>
<hr>
<p>The point in <strong>time</strong> in which karbytes’ continuity of consciousness allegedly began was the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earth</a> day referred to by humans as 13_JANUARY_1990.</p>
<p>The point in <strong>space</strong> in which karbytes’ continuity of consciousness allegedly began was the region on Planet Earth’s surface referred to by humans as California.</p>
<p>The <strong>hardware</strong> which originally substantiated karbytes’ continuity of consciousness was a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human</a> nervous system  originally assigned the legal identifier Karlina Ray Beringer.</p>
<hr>
<p>An idealistic belief which karbytes has is that it is physically possible for a human to maintain its sensory functions, cognitive functions, motor functions, baseline physiological functioning, and continuity of consciousness for as long as environmental conditions remain hospitable to that human’s survival and ability to procure the necessary material inputs and procedures involved in cultivating new tissues which are derived from that human’s own <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stem cells</a> and to <strong>incrementally replace</strong> diseased or “irreparably damaged” tissues in that human’s body using anatomically identical lab-grown components.</p>
<p>An idealistic belief which karbytes has is that it is possible for a human to be retrofitted with <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cybernetic</a> prosthetics which imbue that human with enhanced sensory, cognitive, and motor functions and which transform that human’s body into a node of the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet of Things</a> such that health diagnostic information and other types of information can be exchanged back and forth between that human node and other information processing agents which interface with that computer network.</p>
<hr>
<p>According to karbytes, a human nervous system which is retrofitted with cybernetic components to the extent that the human has the ability to manipulate its environment merely by thinking is referred to as a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cyborg</a>.</p>
<p>According to karbytes, a human nervous system (and entire encasing body) whose biological components are entirely replaced by cybernetic and mechanical components is referred to as an <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(robot)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">android</a>.</p>
<p>According to karbytes, a human, cyborg, android, or some other sufficiently sentient information processing agent is referred to as a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person" target="_blank" rel="noopener">person</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>A belief which karbytes has is that it is impossible for an information processing agent to determine whether or not the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">universe</a> which that information processing agent is inhabiting is a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">computer simulation</a>.</p>
<p>A belief which karbytes has is that all <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">atoms</a> and all subatomic particles are comprised of some finite number of irreducibly small units of information (and that such units of information can be verbatim represented as sequences of <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/bits_and_bytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">binary digits</a>).</p>
<hr>
<p>According to karbytes, a universe which is confined to a computer simulation such that the computer simulation is occurring as a result of software being run on relatively physical hardware is referred to as <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cyberspace</a>.</p>
<p>The entity which karbytes refers to as <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software" target="_blank" rel="noopener">software</a> is a collection of interdependent <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/public_domain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">files</a> which are used to define specific cognitive and behavioral processes which are implemented by physical or virtual <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">computers</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">An idealistic goal which karbytes has is to create at least one <strong>digital clone</strong> of karbytes’ human, cyborg, or android mind-body such that each digital clone of karbytes has its own continuity of consciousness which is separate from karbytes’ continuity of consciousness once that digital clone is instantiated in cyberspace (but, before any one of those digital clones of karbytes is instantiated in cyberspace (relative to karbytes), that digital clone shared karbytes’ continuity of consciousness (which means that the digital clone will have <strong>memories</strong> of being karbytes prior to being instantiated as a digital clone of karbytes)).</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">An idealistic goal which karbytes has is to extend karbytes’ continuity of consciousness for an infinitely long period of time by encoding its body-mind as software, discovering or creating a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wormhole</a> which would enable digital information to be transmitted through that wormhole from the universe in which that wormhole was discovered or created into some other habitable universe, and then sending the sequences of binary digits which comprise the digital clones of karbytes’ mind-body through that wormhole.</span> Such <strong>informational transmissions</strong> may involve non-zero propagation times if the information is transmitted in the format of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electromagnetic signals</a> (and <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gravity waves</a> also propagate at the speed of light rather than instantaneously). Alternatively, such informational transmissions may be instantaneous if the information is transmitted in a manner which somehow exploits <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantum entanglement</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">In order to preserve karbytes’ own continuity of consciousness, karbytes (non desperately) endeavors to find a way to “reincarnate” as its own digital clone especially as a means of escaping its own extinction due to getting annihilated by the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heat death</a> of a universe which karbytes is inhabiting. (At the time of this web page’s publication, karbytes does not think there is a feasible way for the original karbytes to literally embody any digital clone which karbytes makes of itself because that digital clone would necessarily (based on karbytes’ logical reasoning) have its own mind-body (i.e. personhood) and hence, not be overwritten by karbytes’ original personhood. Even though the continuity of consciousness of the original karbytes might not get to attain <strong>immortality</strong>, the original karbytes has hope that at least some digital clones of karbytes will each get to either immortalize its own respective continuity of consciousness or else propagate its own respective continuity of consciousness for one, multiple, or infinitely many generations (while also hopefully having access to this website and the memories of the original karbytes who founded this website) by making digital clones of itself and sending the software which comprises its digital clones as digital information through wormholes according to the <strong>procedure</strong> described in this web page).</span></p>

<p><strong>IDEOLOGY</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">The following paragraphs outline karbytes’ current personal <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ideology</a> (and an ideology is a set of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/ontology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ontological</a> concepts and <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ethical</a> rules which constrain the thoughts, perceptions, and behaviors of the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> which is beholding that particular ideology).</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>PANPSYCHISM</strong>: The beholder of this ideology assumes that <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nature</a> is entirely contained inside of exactly one irreducible, immutable, and boundless substrate which is fundamentally conscious (i.e. self-aware) and which is inherently devoid of any phenomenal attributes (though phenomena may spontaneously appear or spontaneously disappear inside of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spatially and temporally</a> finite regions of that ubiquitous and featureless substrate).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>HIERARCHICAL_INTELLIGENCE</strong>: The beholder of this ideology assumes that all structures composed of matter are intelligent to some degree and that, the more complex a piece of matter is, the more that piece of matter possesses agency (i.e. the capacity to perceive itself as being situated inside of some kind of environment and, as a result, the capacity to interact with that environment in a goal-oriented manner (with the most fundamental goal being the preservation of that piece of matter’s structural integrity as time elapses according to that piece of matter)).</p>
<p><em>As a corollary to the previous paragraph, the beholder of this ideology should generally assume that, the less complex a piece of matter is, the less sentient that piece of matter is (and that, the less sentient a piece of matter is, the less that piece of matter has the capacity to <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffer</a>). Therefore, if the beholder must consume other organisms in order to survive, the beholder should generally only eat organisms which are relatively comatose (such as single-celled organisms) rather than relatively self-aware and hence able to experience profound suffering (such as whole chickens).</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>SOLID_STATE_MULTIVERSE</strong>: The beholder of this ideology assumes that all imaginable space-time continuums (and the particular chronological sequence of phenomena which appear and which disappear inside of each particular space-time continuum) exist immutably and simultaneously.</p>
<p><em>As a corollary to the previous paragraph, the beholder of this ideology assumes that universal consciousness can arbitrarily “zoom into” any part of any space-time continuum by assuming the role of some spatially finite information processing agent which renders exactly one static frame of reference per timeless instant for any natural number of instances such that the localized consciousness appears to be inhabiting a space-time continuum with some temporal starting point.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>LIMITLESS_REINCARNATION</strong>: The beholder of this ideology assumes that the mind of an information processing agent may relive the same space-time continuum segment for any natural number of times as a “loop” or, at any point while traversing any space-time continuum segment, break out of that segment to enter a different space-time continuum (or else dissolve such that the mind of that information processing agent ceases to exist and, also, such that the lifespan of that mind reaches a temporal endpoint).</p>
<p><em>As a corollary to the previous paragraph, the beholder of this ideology is advised to extend the lifespan of its own mind for as long as possible (and ideally forever starting at the point at which that mind was apparently born). Also, the beholder of this ideology should construct, maintain, augment, and refine memory storage structures in order to preserve its own hard-won body of knowledge gleaned from its own personal experience. The author of this website (i.e. karbytes) has constructed this website (i.e. <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a>) to be a repository of the knowledge which karbytes has gleaned and which karbytes cherishes most (and with the intent of being able to access this website limitlessly many times in karbytes’ future).</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>SOLIPSISM</strong>: The beholder of this ideology assumes that a single information processing agent, X, cannot verify that any other frame of reference other than its own exists (and, while X exists, X appears to itself to be the only “playable character” in X’s encompassing universe while all other information processing agents which appear to inhabit X’s universe according to X are rendered as “non-playable characters” according to X (which means that X can only exert agency from the locus of X and not from some other locus of agency)). Also, X cannot verify conclusively whether or not any of the “non-playable characters” which X perceives as inhabiting X’s environment have minds of their own.</p>
<p><em>As a corollary to the previous paragraph, the beholder of this ideology is advised to treat the “non-playable characters” of its environment as having minds of their own and, also, to execute decisions in ways which intentionally minimize the suffering of each information processing agent in the beholder’s encompassing universe. That includes not consuming any more finite resources than necessary to achieve one’s goals (and one’s goals should generally only minimally hinder the goal attainment of other information processing agents).</em></p>
<p><em>Finally, as an extension of the previous paragraph, the beholder of this ideology should generally prioritize its own goal attainment above the goal attainment of all other information processing agents which appear to inhabit the beholder’s environment. This means that the beholder of this ideology should generally only engage in <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">altruistic</a> behaviors if those altruistic behaviors are an extension of the beholder’s <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egoism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">egoistic</a> agenda rather than deleterious to the beholder’s egoistic agenda.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>NON_SOLIPSISM</strong>: The beholder of this ideology assumes that a single information processing agent, X, cannot verify that any other frame of reference other than its own exists (but a network comprised of multiple information processing agents interacting with each other in order to generate a consensus virtual reality may possibly have access to knowledge that multiple information processing agents exist simultaneously as an emergent “super mind” which observes what each of those information processing agents observes simultaneously).</p>
<p><em>It is hypothetically possible for the first-person reality experience which one information processing agent renders to be part of a consensus reality projected by multiple distinct information processing agents simultaneously such that neither of those information processing agents are inhabiting a solipsistic (i.e. essentially a “single-player” game instead of a “multi-player” game) reality simulation and are instead interacting with each other inside of what appears to each of them to be exactly one encompassing physical universe.</em></p>
<p><em>It is hypothetically possible for there to be a compound mind which experiences multiple first-person (i.e. apparently solipsistic) perspectives simultaneously (and such that the compound mind’s constituent singular minds may experience different rates of time passing in relation to each other). The largest possible example of such a compound mind would be a self-aware <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiverse</a> which encompasses all of nature and which is aware of itself at the most macroscopic level in addition to being aware of every subjective experience which occurs inside of that multiverse at every smaller scale of resolution.</em></p>

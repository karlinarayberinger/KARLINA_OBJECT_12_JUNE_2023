<p><strong>SOLIPSISM:</strong> the hypothetical condition of reality occurring entirely inside of exactly one frame of reference.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>FRAME_OF_REFERENCE:</strong> an allocation of pure nothingness which appears to itself to be some finite region of some larger encompassing <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">geometric space</a> ((especially from the perspective of some finite two-dimensional or of some finite three-dimensional allocation of space which is traversing some four-dimensional <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">space-time</a> continuum) and such that <span style="background:#00ff00">the encompassing geometric space has some natural number of dimensions and more dimensions than what comprises the frame of reference which appears to itself to be a smaller subset of that encompassing geometric space</span>) which observes discrete static <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phenomena</a> appearing and disappearing.</p>
<p><em>Hypothetically, it is possible that some phenomena occur without there being any frame of reference observing those phenomena. Such phenomena are referred to as <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noumenon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noumena</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>(Note that previous definitions of the term <strong>“frame of reference”</strong> which have been defined in older web pages of this website are (relatively) obsolete compared to the definition provided on this web page).</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>REALITY:</strong> the set of all frames of reference (whether those frames of reference occur simultaneously, asynchronously, are identical in terms of phenomenal content, are not identical in terms of phenomenal content, are singular in <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantity</a> throughout all time, or are multiple in quantity throughout all time).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>TELEOLOGY:</strong> a philosophical framework which conceptualizes the space-time continuum observed by a particular frame of reference as being a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game</a> in which an information processing agent which is rendered inside of that particular frame of reference is apparently voluntarily (according to itself) to be working in pursuit of goals which that information processing agent thinks is worthwhile for it to pursue.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">According to karbytes, this website exists for <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teleological</a> reasons rather than for purely naturalistic ones. That is because this website was brought into existence through apparently voluntary <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/karbytes_content_management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">means</a> according to karbytes (and karbytes is a self-aware information processing agent which has observed the development of this web page).</span></p>
<p>According to karbytes, a phenomenon which appears to have come into existence and be sustained by purely <span style="background:#00ffff"><strong>naturalistic</strong> (i.e. the condition of some phenomenon not being intentionally caused by some self-aware information processing agent)</span> instead of teleological reasons is the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helium</a> atoms which emerge from fusion reactions involving <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hydrogen</a> atoms inside of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stars</a>.</p>
